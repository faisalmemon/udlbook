\section{Problem}

We run the stochastic gradient descent algorithm for $1,000$ iterations on a dataset of size $100$ with a batch size of $20$. For how many epochs did we train the model?

\section{Answer}

Assuming we don't replace the items selected for each batch.
The first epoc occurs after $\frac{100}{20} = 5$ iterations.
The pool of data is exhausted, so we have done our first epoch.
With $5$ iterations per epoch we have $1000$ iterations so that is $ \frac{1000}{5} = 200$ epochs.
